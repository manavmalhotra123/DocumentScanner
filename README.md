# OpenCV Project - Document Scanner
---
### This is a Python script that uses OpenCV to create a document scanner. The script captures images from a camera and detects the document in the frame. It then applies perspective transformation to get a top-down view of the detected document and saves the scanned image.
---
# Usage 
---
### 1. The script will open a window showing the live camera feed with the scanned document overlaid.
### 2. Press 's' to save the scanned document as an image in the "Scanned" folder (named as myImage1.jpg, myImage2.jpg, etc.).
### 3. Press 'q' to exit the script.
